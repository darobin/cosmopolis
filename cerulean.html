  <!--
    The idea is simple: piggyback on Bluesky with tiles.
    My hope is that we can just use the PDS with a different
    record type, but I'm not sure that it'll take it. Worth
    trying https://atproto.com/guides/applications#repo-crud
    await api.com.atproto.repo.createRecord({
      repo: 'alice.com',
      type: 'it.mycopunk.cerulean' // instead of 'app.bsky.post'
    }, {
      cid: 'some CID uploaded on W3.Storage or whatever',
      createdAt: (new Date()).toISOString()
    })
    - currently the bsky.app PDS rejects all unknown types
    - but it looks like people have been making their own
      PDSs
    - and people have been building their own clients, soâ€¦
    - it should be possible to put these two things together
      and to create a forked version that based on tiles

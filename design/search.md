# Search Implementations

We're unlikely to have working search very soon, however for demo purposes we could:

- Generate tiles for every post on berjon.com
- Generate an index using one of the search tools, like elasticlunr
- Have a UI to search that as the only search source of potentially many
- Show the result as a feed object
- If you're logged in, we can integrate Bluesky search as a source
- Brave?
- DDG?

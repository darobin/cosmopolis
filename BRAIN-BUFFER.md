# What comes next

- [ ] have the tile root itself in an expandable flexbox (if we can animate, even better) so that
      wishes can be placed side by side (recursively when a wish makes a wish)
- [ ] make an image pick wish that just returns a random colour from a canvas as an image
- [ ] support installing and uninstalling a wish
- [ ] make an image pick wish that returns a picture from fetching an image as blob in its own content

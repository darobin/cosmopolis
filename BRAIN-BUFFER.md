# What comes next

- [x] have the tile root itself in an expandable flexbox (if we can animate, even better) so that
      wishes can be placed side by side (recursively when a wish makes a wish)
- [x] make an image pick wish that just returns a random colour from a canvas as an image
- [x] support installing and uninstalling a wish
- [x] support triggering a tile for a wish and having it reply
- [ ] make an image pick wish that returns a picture from fetching an image as blob in its own content
- [x] when a wish tile is shown, scrollIntoView()
- [ ] affordance to cancel wish, and no affordance to install/like/etc. when shown as wish
